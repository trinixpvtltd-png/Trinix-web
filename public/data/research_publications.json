      "abstract": "The judicial administration systems of many countries suffer from serious inefficiencies, including case backlogs, inconsistent legal interpretations, and administrative delays. In India alone, over 50 million cases are pending across all courts (J. Chowdhury, 2025, June 20), highlighting an acute need for reform. Law enforcement agencies and court administrations also face documentation bottlenecks, corruption, and slow evidence collection, all of which hinder timely justice delivery. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Blockchain, and Explainable AI (XAI) into judicial processes presents a transformative opportunity to streamline case resolution, enhance transparency, and improve efficiency in governance.\nThis paper proposes “DharamRaksha,” an AI-powered multi-tier judicial administration platform designed to assist judges, lawyers, law enforcement agencies, and the public in judgment support, case management, legal research, policy implementation, and transparent governance. The system is conceptualized as a sovereign AI platform for the judiciary, tailored to national legal frameworks while interconnected to a global “super-domain” for cross-jurisdictional intelligence sharing and real-time case tracking. The technical feasibility of this framework is examined through its key components: AI-driven legal research tools, automated document drafting, blockchain-secured evidence management, and real-time adjudication support. We evaluate the anticipated economic and administrative impacts of AI-driven judicial automation and discuss the ethical considerations, bias mitigation strategies, and regulatory compliance measures necessary for responsible implementation. While early deployments of AI in judicial contexts have occurred in countries like China, Estonia, and the UK, these have been limited in scope and raised concerns about transparency, fairness, and judicial autonomy. The proposed model aims to overcome such challenges through robust human oversight, XAI-based explainability, and a structured AI governance framework.\nThe paper presents a AI-assisted legal modernization framework as a benchmark; this research offers a feasible roadmap for integrating AI into judicial administration in India and beyond. Leveraging AI for legal governance has the potential to significantly reduce case backlogs, improve decision-making efficiency, and ensure fair and accountable adjudication in both national and international jurisdictions, provided that these technologies are deployed with careful attention to ethical and legal safeguards.",

These \"aerial chariots\" or \"flying palaces\" are depicted with astonishing capabilities, ranging from autonomous flight and swift maneuvers to shape-shifting and sophisticated weaponry.

The framework connects traditional rasa theory with affective neuroscience and computational psychology to construct a multi-dimensional emotion-AI model capable of understanding and generating emotional responses aligned with human affective states. It emphasizes dataset formation based on physiological, linguistic, and contextual markers; multimodal emotion analysis (voice, facial data, semantics); and reinforcement feedback loops for AI empathy and behavior regulation. The research further outlines the mapping of Navarasa categories into vector representations for use in deep learning and conversational agents.",
